# Routing Optimization with Machine Learning

This project applies various machine learning and optimization algorithms to solve routing optimization problems. The aim is to find efficient paths or schedules for different scenarios, such as logistics, delivery services, or transportation networks. The project leverages data-driven approaches to improve route planning and reduce costs or travel times.

## Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implements and compares various machine learning and optimization techniques for routing.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilizes real or synthetic datasets to model routing scenarios.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates algorithm performance using metrics such as cost, time efficiency, and scalability.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representations of optimized routes for better understanding and analysis.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: Simulates natural selection to find optimal or near-optimal routing solutions.
- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: Explores the solution space by probabilistically accepting worse solutions to escape local optima.
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Mimics the behavior of ants to find optimal paths through pheromone-based learning.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Models social behavior to optimize routes by simulating particles' movement in the solution space.
